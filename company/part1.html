<h1><strong><span class="rendered_qtext" style="color: #000000;">What should be the satisfactory answer in an interview if they ask why your academic percentage got gradually reduced from 90% till 12th to 70% in engineering?</span></strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I believe i am of such nature, if<strong> problem araises</strong> then without finding<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> reasonable solution</span></strong> it doesnot gives me <strong>satisfaction</strong>.After I joined <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>engineering</strong> </span>lot of technology developed and I was more inclined towards solving those queries rather than<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> mugging up the syllabus</strong></span>. I believe knowledge acquired practically through research is far more valuable than bookish knowledge perhaps this reason lead to downfall in my marks</span></p>
