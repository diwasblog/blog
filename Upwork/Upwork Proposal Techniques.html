    <p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Step 1 ) Start like this: &ldquo;<strong><span style="color: #000000;">Hi. I just
                    read your job posting and it sounds like you need ___</span></strong>&rdquo;.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Step 2) Middle Part: Then share something about <strong><span
                    style="color: #000000;">your background</span></strong> and ideally <strong><span
                    style="color: #000000;">how you've helped other clients solve the same problem</span></strong>. Show
            them you are an expert on that. But only 4-5 sentences is enough. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Step 3) End Proposal :</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">The first option is to<span style="color: #000000;"><strong> ask a question about
                    their project/needs? </strong></span>If you haven't already asked a question in
            your</span><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt;">proposal body like: &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #000000;">Do you have websites so I can understand this more?
            </span></strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong><span style="font-size: 24pt; color: #000000;">Notes: You should be saying &ldquo;<span
                    style="color: #2dc26b;">you</span>&rdquo; at LEAST as much as you&rsquo;re saying, &ldquo;<span
                    style="color: #2dc26b;">I</span>&rdquo;.</span></strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">I just read your posting. It sounds like you need an expert in cold emails
                to advise you on everything from the content to the overall strategy.</span></strong></p>

    <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Sample 2</span></strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Hi! Just read your posting. Sounds like you need an email expert to advise
                you on a few things&hellip; from funnel setup and strategy, to what you should offer to get signups in
                the first place.</span></strong></p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">I have a background in funnels and email copywriting and have been doing
                this for 3 years, including for some other subscription/membership businesses.</span></strong></p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">I can work with you to come up with a great strategy and high-converting
                emails to turn your prospects into paying customers. And I can help you get more email signups going
                into this funnel, too.</span></strong></p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">If any of the above sounds interesting, let me know when you&rsquo;d be
                available to talk this week.</span></strong></p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Best regards,</span></strong><br /><strong><span

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Follow this:</span></strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Use the first line to show that you&rsquo;ve read their profile and understand what they need (instead of
            saying your name and talking about yourself).</li>
        <li>Introduce yourself and explain why you&rsquo;re an expert in what they need.</li>
        <li>Make a recommendation or ask a question to reinforce the fact that you&rsquo;re an expert in this topic.
        </li>
        <li>Close with a Call to Action to get them to reply. Either ask for a website to learn more, or ask them when
            they&rsquo;re available to talk.</li>
        <li>Sign off with your name.</li>
        <li>Keep everything brief. Aim for less than 120 words in your Upwork proposal. 85-100 words is ideal.</li>
        <li>Use great spacing; you should only have two to three sentences MAXIMUM per paragraph in your proposal.</li>
        <li>Only send proposals for jobs posted on Upwork within the last 24 hours. You&rsquo;ll be more likely to get
            the interview if you do this.</li>
        <li>Commit to sending out proposals five days per week (Monday &ndash; Friday) for at least a month to build up
            your leads on Upwork.</li>
        <li>Price yourself near the top of the client&rsquo;s range. Never compete on price and never try to be the
            cheapest.</li>
        <li>Make sure you have a great Upwork profile that backs up everything you&rsquo;re saying in your Upwork
            proposal.</li>
    </ol>
