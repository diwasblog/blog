<p>Strong typing: It checks the type of variables as soon as possible, usually at compile time. It prevents mixing operations between mismatched types.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #ff00ff;">A strong-typed programming language is one in which:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">All variables (or data types) are known at compile time</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">All exceptions to typing rules results in a compile time error</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #ff00ff;">Weak Typing Programming Language is one in which</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> While weak typing is delaying checking the types of the system as late as possible, usually to run-time. In this you can mix types without an explicit conversion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #ff00ff;">which is preferred ?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">depends on what you want. for scripts and good stuff you will usually want weak typing, because you want to write as much less code as possible. in big programs, strong typing can reduce errors at compile time.</span></p>
