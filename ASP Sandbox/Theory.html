<p><span style="font-size: 24pt;">Roslyn- Open Compiler vs Traditional Closed Compiler</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #000000;">Traditional compiler were <strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">black boxes </span></strong>-- source code goes in one end, magic happens in the compiler(in middle), and then object files or assemblies come to other ends. All the main things are done by the compiler and we don't know what is happening inside. The only employee of the Microsoft building compiler knows all about it. This is one of the downside as the code of compiler is not&nbsp;public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #000000;">So, Microsoft introduced an <strong><span style="color: #2dc26b;">open compiler</span></strong> called Roslyn for everyone and is <strong><span style="color: #2dc26b;">hosted on GitHub</span></strong> and is used from visual studio 2015. This allows you to see the way it works and in case of an error &mdash; report it to the developers. <strong><span style="color: #2dc26b;">So, the developer if found any error then he/she can looks on the compiler code on Github and suggestions for improvement to Microsoft.</span></strong></span></p>
