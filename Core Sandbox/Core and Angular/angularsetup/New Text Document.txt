In HTTP
- Message transfer will be in plain text.
- Vulnerable to Hackers.
- If doesnot pass any sensitive data then http is OK.

So HTTPS is developed
-HTTP with a security features.
- ANy things transfer between server to client then it is encrypted and even hacker tapped the data then that data makes no sense to him.


HTTPS protects the data by one of two protocal .
1)SSL: Secure Socket Layer
- Uses Public Key encryption

Here, what happens is : if you required a sites which uses SSL, then when you hit on browser and will reached server, then server will send SSL certificate of the websites then this 
certificate reached browser and then browser will check is this certificate real ? If yes then communication between them continue in encrypted fashion.


2)TLS
Latest version of SSL.


Lots of sites nowadays uses https by default as provided by hosting provider.
