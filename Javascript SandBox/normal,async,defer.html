    <h2>
      Note here: In above example we are loading js at end of head section, and
      defer works best for executing js after html parse, also if there are
      numerous js then also it load js in order manner.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      So, putting js with defer tag at head section is equivalent to loading js
      at end of body tag because when js is put at end of body tag then all html
      parsing will be completed then js gets executed .
