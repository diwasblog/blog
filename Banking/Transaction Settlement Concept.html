<p><span style="font-size: 24pt;">When should I <strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">void a transaction</span></strong> and when should I <strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">refund the transaction</span></strong>?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Suppose you are buying goods from the supermarket, then you will give him Credit Card / Debit Card for payment.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #2dc26b;">Void Transaction</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 18pt;">When Credit/Debit Card is inserted into POS machine, then POS authenticate the user and check whether the user has sufficient balance or not, if has sufficient balance, the required amount is withdrawn from the User Account.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 18pt;">When the User cannot use that transaction amount.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 18pt;">And this will get stored in the POS system say <strong><span style="color: #2dc26b;">in the vault (digital form) </span></strong>and will not go to the merchant account in bank at that time. At the END of DAY (EOD) or at night, all transactions are batched up for settlement(sync with the bank) by supermarket staff. And at that point, the funds are transferred to a merchant bank account. &nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 18pt;">If the transaction is not settled (or say money is in the POS vault ) then you can void the transaction.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 18pt;">When the transaction is void by the merchant then the User will get his money back with no transaction fee because that money was just in the vault.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #2dc26b;"><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Refund Transaction</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #2dc26b;">If the transaction is settled</span></strong>( ie. say money is sync with merchant Account in the bank) then you can refund the transaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">In this process, the User has to wait 4-5 business days for getting his money back. This process is called Refund Transaction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Conclusion:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">So, if the transaction is in the <strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">unsettled stage </span></strong>then we can <strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">void the transaction</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">If the transaction is already <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>settled </strong></span>then we can <strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">refund the transactio</span></strong>n.</span></p>
