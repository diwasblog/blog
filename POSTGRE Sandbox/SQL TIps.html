<h2>To Import .sql file</h2>
First you must goto bin path of postgre and then open command prompt there. then
types below command psql -U username -h host -f location-of-sql-file psql -U
postgres -h localhost -f J:\firstsave.sql test2 postgres ==>Username localhost
===> Host


========================================================
Always keep default value for bool in database.
======================================================
Use NOCOUNT for Large Batch Queries

When you perform insert and update to the database then it will always return total no. of row affected.

But In a production if you perform insert and update regularly then it is not necessary to send back no.
of row affected so use NO COUNT for large Queries

===========================
Always Consider Performance, Even If the Query Seems Simple because application can grow any time.

==============================================

Always think about relationship in database eg. Student and School

================================================
USE TABLE ALIASES FOR EASIER READING
===========================================

Be Specific in Your SELECT Clauses

select * from table (Bad Way)
select a ,b from table ( Good Way)
================================================
Know how SQL Actually Works:

Order of Keyword:

SELECT
FROM
WHERE
GROUP BY
ORDER BY
LIMIT

Order of Execution:

FROM
WHERE
GROUP BY
SELECT
ORDER BY
LIMIT

SQL first checks which data table we will work with. Then it checks the filters. After that it groups the data.
Finally it gets the data – and if necessary, sorts it and prints only the first X lines.

====================================================================================

Prettify Your Code (https://codebeautify.org/sqlformatters)


=========================================================================

All reserve keyword : UpperCase
All field values, column names and table names: Lowercase.

=================================================================
Comment if necessary
========================================================
Always use the actual name of the columns in ORDER BY , GROUP BY and never use number
======================================================================

Use the more readable ANSI-Standard Join clauses instead of the old style joins.

Old Style: (This creates cartesian join)
=========
SELECT a.Au_id,

t.Title

FROM TITLES t,

AUTHORS a,

TITLEAUTHOR ta

WHERE a.Au_id = ta.Au_id

AND ta.Title_id = t.Title_id

AND t.Title LIKE ‘%Computer%’

ANSI Standard
============

SELECT a.Au_id,

t.Title

FROM AUTHORS a

INNER JOIN TITLEAUTHOR ta

ON a.Au_id = ta.Au_id

INNER JOIN TITLES t

ON ta.Title_id = t.Title_id

WHERE t.Title LIKE ‘%Computer%’

===================================================
Always use a column list in your INSERT statements This helps in avoiding problems when the table structure changes
(like adding or dropping a column).

Don't Use:
INSERT INTO EuropeanCountries VALUES (1, ‘Ireland’)

Better Use:
INSERT INTO EuropeanCountries (CountryID, CountryName) VALUES (1, ‘England’)

=================================================================

Do not prefix your stored procedure names with “sp_”

The prefix sp_ is reserved for system stored procedure that ship with SQL Server.Whenever SQL Server encounters a
procedure name starting with sp_, it first tries to locate the procedure in the master database, then it looks for any
qualifiers (database, owner) provided, then it tries dbo as the owner.

======================================================================
Names must begin with a letter and may not end with an underscore.
=====================================================
Avoid the use of multiple consecutive underscores—these can be hard to read.
=================================================================
Donot prefix table name with tbl.
===============================================
Never give a table the same name as one of its columns and vice versa.

================================================
Stored procedures
=== The name must contain a verb
=== Do not prefix with sp_


================================================================
Make use of BETWEEN where possible instead of combining multiple statements with AND


SELECT COUNT(productid) FROM public.order_details where productid between 1 AND 40

SELECT COUNT(productid) FROM public.order_details where

====================================================================================

For Date Related Better use Between Instead of writing multiple column name

SELECT * FROM public.employees where birthdate between '1937-09-19' AND '1966-01-27'

SELECT * FROM public.employees where birthdate >= '1937-09-19' AND birthdate



=================================================================


use IN() instead of multiple OR
clauses

Bad
===
SELECT * FROM `members` WHERE `membership_number` = 1 || `membership_number`= 2 || `membership_number` = 3);


Good
===

SELECT * FROM `members` WHERE `membership_number` IN (1,2,3);


=======================================

Instead use NOT EXISTS â€¢Use MINUS instead of EXISTS

Use MINUS Instead of EXISTS SubQueries Using MINUS is faster than NOT
EXISTS and EXISTS Sub Queries
============================================

Avoid LIKE predicate

Always replace 'like' with equility when appropriate

===========================================

Always generate an execution plan for all production SQL


===========================================================================
Use Like Query like this :

Charleston, Charlotte, and Charlton,Cape Charles, Crab Orchard, and Richardson

We want name start with char:

SELECT City FROM Customers WHERE City LIKE ‘%Char%’

Output : Charleston, Charlotte, and Charlton,Cape Charles, Crab Orchard, and Richardson

==
But want only Charleston, Charlotte, Charlton, Cape Charles so query is

SELECT City FROM Customers WHERE City LIKE ‘Char%’


=========================================================
Try to avoid “TABLE OR INDEX SCAN” in queries
======================================================
Use TRY-CATCH block for error handling

=======================================================
Avoid SubQueries
Badly written queries always damage SQL Server performance.

Bad
===
SELECT p.Name,(SELECT pm.Name FROM Production.ProductCategory pm WHERE pm.ProductCategoryID=p.ProductSubcategoryID)
AS modelname FROM production.Product p

Good
===
SELECT
P.NAME ,PM.NAME FROM
production.Product p LEFT JOIN
Production.ProductCategory pm ON pm.ProductCategoryID=p.ProductSubcategoryID
