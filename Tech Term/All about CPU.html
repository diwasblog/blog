    <p><span style="font-size: 24pt; color: #000000;">Logical Core vs Physical Core</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">CPU in a CPU socket may have many physical cores.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #000000;">If a CPU processor has 2 physical core then it is called a
            dual-core.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #000000;">If a CPU processor has 4 physical core then it is called 4
            core.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="color: #f1c40f;">Logical Cores</span> =<span
                style="color: #000000;"><strong> # of Physical Core *&nbsp; Thread on each core&nbsp;
                    &nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">&nbsp;If I have a computer that has a 4-core processor, runs two threads per core,
            then&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Logical Processor = 4 * 2 = 8 Logical Processor, </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">This concept of behaving 1&nbsp; processor (physical processor) as 2 processor
            (logical processor) is hyperthreading. Hyperthreading makes a Physical Processor to behave like it has two
            Physical Processors, which are called Logical Processor. </span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">This above hardware has a processor with 4 core (obtained called as 4 physical
            processor units) and has 2 thread in each core so altogether this processor has (4*2) =8 logical
            processor(as shown right of the figure).</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Each physical core has its own circuitry and its own L1 (and usually L2) cache can
            read and execute instructions separately (for the most part) from the other physical cores on the
            chip.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">A quad-(physical) core i7 processor will have eight logical cores. However, the
            two logical cores within one physical core cannot truly operate in parallel with respect to each other. But
            works interleaving or concurrency so that one logical processor does half of the task on one work and
            another logical processor does half on other work and soon and continuously interleaved.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">N ote one thing that : Core and Core works parallelly and donot interleave, each
            core has its own read and execute instruction. And Thread in a same core works by interleaving.</span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 24pt;">Concurrency vs Parallelism</span></p>
    <p>Concurrency : Example : Eat and speak are two task , we cannot do both at same time but we interleaved. When
        eating stop talking and vice versa.</p>
    <p>Parallism : Example: Singing and Dancing are two task and can be done <span
            style="font-size: 18pt;">parallelly/<span style="color: #f1c40f;">simultaneously</span></span>. No switching
        over the task.</p>
