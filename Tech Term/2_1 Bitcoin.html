<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">In the current process for amount transaction between two parties, we need third party entities and that <strong><span style="color: #000000;">third parties entity</span></strong> can be a bank. Suppose <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>A wants to transfer money to B</strong></span>, then A has to go to bank and pay a certain charges to bank and bank will transfer that money to intended account ie to the account of B. But in bitcoin we don't need third parties , directly A can send <strong><span style="color: #000000;">digital currency</span></strong> (<strong><span style="color: #000000;">not physical currency</span></strong>) to B with no any broker in between them . And this whole system is handled by Blockchain Technology.</span></p>
