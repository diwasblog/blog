<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #000000;">Test-Driven Development (TDD) consists of <strong><span style="color: #2dc26b;">writing the tests before writing the code</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #000000;">First of all, the test is written and must fail at the beginning. Then, the code is written so that the test passes. Then, the test must be executed and must succeed. Then, the code is refactored. Then, the test must be executed again to ensure that the code is correct. </span></p>
