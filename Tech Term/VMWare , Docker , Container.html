    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #000000;">When you as developer build your
            application and from your perspective, you check the project and is working while and then now you will give
            the project(via zip or anything) to tester then tester will load the project and tester will find that
            project is not working in their environment because there may be dependency issue. Suppose you are using
            windows 10 and tester is using windows xp then there may be a dependency issue. Suppose say you have .net
            framework 4.5 installed in your machine and tester just has .net framework 4.0 then there may occur problem
            in a testing environment.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong><span style="font-size: 24pt; color: #2dc26b;">The solution is VMWare or Hypervisor&nbsp;</span></strong>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #000000;">In VMWare or Virtual Machine or
            Hypervisor, you can install OS, software, and application.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #000000;">To solve this problem developers
            create an image of working OS (containing working project along with dependencies) and then gives the entire
            image of OS then the tester will load the image then test it. Here, tester has not to worry anything because
            the developer has given everything. Then tester creates test code and everything works well then they again
            create an image of OS and give it to operation team. Then the operation team checks it and if all OK then
            they install the image of OS with software in the production server.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Suppose say you have <span style="color: #2dc26b;"><strong>10 application
                </strong></span>then may have <span style="color: #2dc26b;">10 different types of image of OS</span>
            then these<strong><span style="color: #2dc26b;"> 10 virtual OS is installed on the main server (say Linux
                    OS)</span></strong>. But the problem with virtual OS is :</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #e03e2d;">They take hardware space (HDD, RAM,
                    Processor)&nbsp;</span></strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="color: #2dc26b;"><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Again to reduce resource usage: Docker came
                    into the picture</span></strong></span></p>
