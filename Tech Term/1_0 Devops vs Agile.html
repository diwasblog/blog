<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Many big companies like amazon, netflix, target ,walmart uses devops techniques and
    finds considerable improvement in delivery and quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">What operation and Development Team in Devops
        ?</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Suppose I have developed the robot for training it and for operation of that robot I
    kept that robot to operation teams called RoboOperation.But while When robot is set in operational environment then
    robot started to malfunction so for that operation team and development (me) team should colaboration with each
    other and solve the problem.And this collaboration between Development and Operations team makes devops practice in
    use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">But in agile practice , development and operation team donot collaboration with each
    other.</span></p>

Devops uses these tools for automation


<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #000000;">Why Devops ?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #000000;">The problems DevOps tries to address are in the name. It aims to overcome the <strong><span style="color: #2dc26b;">institutional divide between the team that writes the code (Dev) and the team that manages the infrastructure and tools used to run and manage the product (Ops). </span></strong>As&nbsp;software development life cycles get more complex, it has gotten harder and harder to track responsibilities for the outcome and <strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">easier to blame other departments for bottlenecks, delayed deadlines or shortcomings in the quality of the product</span></strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #000000;">Dev, QA, and the often further fragmented Ops groups may be unaware of each other&rsquo;s roadblocks, have little insight into the business context, or even aim for opposing goals. Mistrust is harming the organization and leaves everyone involved unhappy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
